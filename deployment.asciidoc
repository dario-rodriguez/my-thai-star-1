= Deployment

The main deployment tool used for *My Thai Star* is be *Docker*.

It is a tool to run application in isolated environments. Those _isolated environments_ will be what we call *Docker containers*. For instance, it won't be necessary any installation of *nginx* or *Apache tomcat* or anything necessary to deploy, because there will be some containers that actually _have_ those technologies inside.

=== Where Docker containers will be running?

Of course, it is necessary to have an external Deployment Server. Every Docker process will run in it. It will be accessed from Production Line pipelines via *SSH*. Thus, the pipeline itself will manage the scenario of, if every previous process like testing passes as OK, stop actual containers and create new ones.

This external server will be located in http://de-mucdevondepl01 .
